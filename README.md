# `deobsmd`

Python script that removes [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) from Markdown and strips excessive newlines. I'll be probably adding new ones as I see fit.

Requires python3.10+ but otherwise no dependencies.

On Linux, add the alias to your [`.bashrc`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/bashrc-file-in-linux) (or whatever file plays its role on your OS) and enjoy.

```bash
alias deobsmd='python3.10 <path-to-directory>deobsmd.py'
```
